I obtained my Master of Computer Science in June 2025, with a focus on networking, systems, and security. 

I then began working as a teaching assistant and Ph.D. student in Computer Science at UCLouvain. My research interests include the Internet of Things (IoT), networking and security.

**Title** : Honeypot for IoT networks using Matter/Thread

##### Abstract
The adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) is growing every year, transforming a wide variety of sectors, including healthcare, cars and smart homes. Smart homes are becoming popular, aiming to make our daily lives easier by performing simple or complex tasks such as closing the curtains at sunset or turning on the heating when a certain temperature is reached. However, this growing connectivity also introduces security challenges. As more devices become connected, new security breaches in home networks may arise. To counter this, research and testing are essential.
In this context, I designed and implemented a Matter over Thread honeypot. Matter over Thread is a new technology standard for IoT that is designed for reliable and secure communication between smart devices. The honeypot simulates a vulnerable smart home network and monitors the behaviour of potential attackers on such a misconfigured network. To prevent the honeypot from compromising the actual home network, I detail methods for its secure isolation. Furthermore, I present three attacker scenarios to demonstrate the types of data that can be collected and analysed by the honeypot.
